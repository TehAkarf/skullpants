        The game starts off with annon text asking about refelections and mirror images. Talking about the disconnect between reality on mentality.  


Stage 1 -  Home 


        Alice is fixing her bed, a carasel on her nightstand turns. The world seperates into the real and reflection. The bedroom itself is very similar between real and reflection, spare things the call to the future levels (Broken mirror, outside envrio, the barrier of the door, the image of the couple), 


        Leave the bedroom, down the hallway, images of family distorted, there is the family, preparing for breakfest, They are all ghosts, speaking nonesense, slowly everything starts to fade till she’s sitting alone at a table with a bottle with a tag on it, “Drink me”
